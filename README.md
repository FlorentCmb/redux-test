### Little description

This is an app where I test some Redux stuff (a counter and a theme manager currently).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run safe-start`

If it's the first time you get the app, this command will install all required modules and then start the app

#### `npm start`

It will start the app in development mode
